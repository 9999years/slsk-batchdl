- configuration profiles, auto-profiles
- album aggregate download mode
- automatically browse user shares during album downloads to guarantee that all files from the parent folder are downloaded
- skip-existing is now much faster. Default mode is now m3u as it is more reliable. Changed how m3u skip-existing works (not backward compatible). Added `m3u-cond` skip mode. m3u modes can now skip album downloads.
- can now download entire bandcamp artist discographies
- added `--on-complete` to run a command whenever a file is downloaded
- now also looks in the user config directories for `sldl.conf`
- many bug fixes
